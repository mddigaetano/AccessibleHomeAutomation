# AccessibleHomeAutomation

The aim of this project is to build a small prototype of an automated house, using a Raspberry (Pi3 in my case, but everyone else should be fine) and an Arduino-compatible board.

Right now, it just makes some LEDs turn on/off.

I'm currently working on adding RGB LEDs, a small DC engine (to power a fan), a gas sensor support... Maybe more!

This project should also work in a real environment, having light bulbs, high voltage and relays managing the actual work.
